I would use Matryoshka dolls as a model for the concept of nesting loops within
each other. Each individual doll is its own loop (if, for, or while), and when
you place a doll within another doll it's just like nesting a loop within another
loop. You start at the inner loop (smallest doll) and make your way to the outer
loop (the next biggest doll) after completing the inner loop each time.
